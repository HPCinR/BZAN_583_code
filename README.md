# BZAN_583_code

A companion repository to HPCinR/BZAN_583 for bringing code to remote computing.

The repository is set up as a Template so that when copied,  

- template history is not copied  
- it is disconnected from the Template  
- activity in the copy is credited to the copy owner (unlike forks)  
- it can still be updated from the Template with some work in your git command line interface (see [Updating Templates](https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/how-to-create-and-manage-github-templates-to-easily-create-new-projects/) on how and more information about Templates)
